# Ops-201-Challenges

This repo is a product of all of the OPS challenges from the 201 class at Code Fellows for Cyber Security. I am learning multiple scripting skills and languages. Using Windows PowerShell and Bash, I was able to learn to use scripts to complete and automate tasks. My favorite assignment in this repo is Day06Conds.sh. I found combining functions/conditions/variables into one script to be challenging however I felt accomplished when I complete my first script that successfully included all 3 aspects.  These scripts can be applied to the workplace as they make daily task for System Admins easier. Having the ability to create a script to automate a task provides efficiency.  These 4 weeks of being introduced to scripting flew by, however if I had more time, I would like to improve on getting comfortable with common commands and being able to interrupt the script.
